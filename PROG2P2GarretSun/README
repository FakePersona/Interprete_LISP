This lisp interpreter was written as an assignement for the advanced programmation class at ENS
Rennes by Antonin Garret and RÃ©my Sun.

Two versions of the code are presented:

- The one in the Copie directory is largely deprecated but left for reasons exposed in the rapport.
  It is also largely uncommented aside from the env.cc file which is the ONLY relevant file in that directory.
  To use it, compile with make and then (rlwrap) ./lisp.

- The one in the Scheme directory is the definitive version of the code and implements closures and frames
  the Scheme way. A documentation is provided (with file include hierarchy!) in the Documentation folder. To
  read it, read the index.html file with a web browser.
  To use it, compile with make and then (rlwrap) ./lisp.
